This project demonstrates the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript.  
It includes several classes such as Book, User, Librarian, Reader, Loan, and Library, which together simulate a simple library management system.

The project shows practical use of:
- Classes and inheritance
- Method overriding
- Encapsulation and object interaction
- Static methods
- Arrays and object management in OOP context
